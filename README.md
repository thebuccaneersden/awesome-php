Let's build awesome PHP micro services

The purpose for this project was to demonstrate how to build a proper, modern PHP implementation of a micro-service that calculates factorials.

Since this is the Lumen micro-framework, start by looking at `app/Http/routes.php` and go on from there.

To start a local development server, simply go into the public/ folder (cd public) and execute:

```
php -S localhost:8887 index.php
```
